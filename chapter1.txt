To much of my dismay, today I received the gift.
I stared at it, fear and suspicion paralizing me. I wouldn't dare touch it. 
I haven't been outside for a while. They won't topup my oxygen tank after the incident. 
We're not supposed to be here, I thought. You'll be called crazy if you say that outloud. "We're
not supposed to be here", my grandmother would always say that. That was the only thing she'd 
say calmly and clearly. Most of the time what came out of her mouth was incoherent ramblings of
flowers and the sun.
